                                It
                                covers 65.401 km2 with more than 11.6 million inhabitants from the territories Lorraine

                                Luxembourg.<br><br>The concept of the Greater Region has its origins in the
                                intergovernmental
                                commission set up
                                by Germany and France in 1969. Two years later, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg joined the
                                commission, followed by the German federal states Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate, the
                                French region Lorraine as well as the Federation Wallonia-Brussels and the

                                Throughout history, the territories of the Greater Region have been shaped by numerous

                            <p>Luxembourg,
                                officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a small landlocked country in
                                western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east,
                                and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the three official
                                capitals of the European Union (together with Brussels and Strasbourg) and the seat
                                of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU. <br><br>Its
                                culture,
                                people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially
                                a mixture of French and German cultures, as evident by the nation's three official
                                languages: French, German, and the national language, Luxembourgish. The repeated
                                invasions by Germany, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will
                                for mediation between France and Germany and, among other things, led to the foundation
                                of the European Union. <br><br>
                                Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number
                                of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country.
                                There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the
                                National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the
                                new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military
                                History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of
                                the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on
                                account of the historical importance of its fortifications.<br><br>

                                The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Théo
                                Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose The
                                Family of Man exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and
                                is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish
                                descent. <br>Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture
                                twice.<br><br>
                                Luxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic
                                worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More
                                recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.

                                Most native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in
                                the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring Germany.<br><br>
                                Luxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.However, the large
                                proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to
                                the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is
                                thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg
                                population.<br><br>

                                Lorraine is
                                a cultural and historical region in north-eastern France, now located in the
                                administrative region of Grand Est. Lorraine's name stems from the medieval kingdom of
                                Lotharingia, which in turn was named for either Emperor Lothair I or King Lothair II. It
                                later was ruled as the Duchy of Lorraine before the Kingdom of France annexed it in
                                1766.<br><br>
                                Traditional dishes in the region include: Quiche Lorraine,
                                Pâté lorrain (chopped pork and veal flavoured with white wine and baked in puff pastry)
                                Potée lorraine (a stew of smoked meats and sausages, with cabbage, potatoes and other
                                root vegetables), Andouille (tripe sausage). Traditional cheeses of Lorraine include the
                                following: Carré de l'Est, Brouère,
                                Munster-géromé, Tourrée de l'Aubier. Desserts include: Madeleine, Macaron, Rum baba,
                                Plombières ice-cream, various pie
                                recipes (brimbelles bilberry, mirabelle plum, rhubarb, quark...).<br><br>

                                is a region of Belgium. As the southern portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily
                                French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of Belgium's territory and a third of its

                                The capital of Wallonia is Namur, and the most populous city is Charleroi. Most of

                                Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the
                                southeast lie the Ardennes, hilly and sparsely populated.<br><br>
                                    Something interesting about festivals. The Ducasse de Mons (Walloon French for
                                    Kermesse), is one of the UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of
                                    Humanity. It comprises two important parts: the procession, the descent and the
                                    ascent of the shrine of Waltrude, and the combat between Saint George and the
                                    dragon. The combat (after the procession), plays out on the Trinity Sunday between
                                    12:30 pm and 1:00 pm on the Mons's central square. It represents the fight between
                                    Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The dragon is a mannequin carried
                                    and moved by the white men (fr:Hommes blancs). The dragon fights Saint George by
                                    attacking with his tail. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise and the dragon
                                    turns in the other direction. Saint George finally kills the dragon.

                                    The Gilles of Binche and the giants' procession in Ath are also UNESCO Masterpieces
                                    of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.<br><br>
                                    Wallonia is famous for a number of different foods and drinks, a great many of which
                                    are specialties of certain cities or regions. The 1957 Michelin Guide noted that
                                    "regional food has put up heroic resistance and the Walloon provinces and Flemish
                                    provinces are proud of their specialities." The Liège waffle a rich, dense,
                                    sweet, and chewy waffle native to Liège, is the most popular type of waffle in
                                    Belgium, and can be found in stores and even vending machines throughout the
                                    country. Cougnou, or the bread of Jesus, is a sweet bread typically eaten around
                                    Christmas time and found throughout the region.<br><br>

                                    Other specialties include Herve cheese, an apple butter called sirop de Liège, the
                                    Garden strawberry of Wépion. Also notable is the Dinant specialty Flamiche: These
                                    cheese tarts are not found in window displays as they are meant to be eaten straight
                                    from the oven. As one restaurateur said so well in a book about Walloon gastronomy
                                    "it is the client who waits for the flamiche, as the flamiche does not wait for the
                                    client. There are also the Ardennes ham, the tarte al djote from Nivelles, a
                                    dessert pie made with beet leaves and cheese,[54] while tarte au riz is a
                                    rice-pudding filled pie from Verviers.<br><br>

                                    In terms of drink, Wallonia mirrors Belgium as a whole; beer and wine are both
                                    popular, and a great diversity of beers are made and enjoyed in Wallonia.<br><br>

                                Saarland is located in western Germany covering an area of 2,570 km2 (990 sq mi) and a
                                population of 995,600 (2015), the smallest German state in both area and population
                                apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg.Saarbrücken is the state
                                capital and largest city, while other major cities include Neunkirchen and Saarlouis.
                                Saarland is surrounded by France to the west (apart from a few kms. of the Moselle river
                                bordering Luxembourg) and south and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate to the
                                north and east.<br><br>
                                Live music is a feature of Saarland, especially at open-air concerts and in atmospheric
                                locations. Examples include the Antattack Festival at the Dillinger Lokschuppen venue,
                                the rock festival at the Hüttenpark former industrial site in Neunkirchen, and the
                                RockCamp Festival at the open-air swimming pool in Saarwellingen. Even the Saarbrücken
                                university campus likes it loud – at the AStA Open Air Festival. But for the season's
                                really big event you have to go up into Püttlingen forest: Rocco del Schlacko. The event
                                started out in 1999 as a mini festival that attracted 600 people and five local bands,
                                but now attracts 20,000 fans who make the earth tremble at the Sauwasen site where it's
                                held. The flamboyantly named open-air festival, which is held in a typical Saarland
                                natural setting, has developed into a regular feature of the German summer festival
                                season.<br><br>
                                Rhineland-Palatinate is located in western Germany covering an area of 19,846 km2 (7,663
                                sq mi) and a population of 4.05 million inhabitants, the seventh-most populous German
                                state. Mainz is the state capital and largest city, while other major cities include
                                Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Koblenz, Trier, Kaiserslautern, and Worms.<br><br>
                                With 42% of its area covered by forests, it is the most forested state along with
                                Hesse. The state's major rivers are the Rhine, including the UNESCO World Heritage
                                Site Middle Rhine, and the Moselle. Several crater lakes of volcanic origin are in the
                                Eifel, the biggest of which is the Laacher See.<br><br>

                                                officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a small landlocked country in
                                                western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east,
                                                and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is one of the three official
                                                capitals of the European Union (together with Brussels and Strasbourg) and the seat
                                                of the European Court of Justice, the highest judicial authority in the EU. <br><br>Its
                                                culture,
                                                people, and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbours, making it essentially
                                                a mixture of French and German cultures, as evident by the nation's three official
                                                languages: French, German, and the national language, Luxembourgish. The repeated
                                                invasions by Germany, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will
                                                for mediation between France and Germany and, among other things, led to the foundation
                                                of the European Union. <br><br>
                                                Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number
                                                of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country.
                                                There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the
                                                National Museum of History and Art (NMHA), the Luxembourg City History Museum, and the
                                                new Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art (Mudam). The National Museum of Military
                                                History (MNHM) in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the Battle of
                                                the Bulge. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on
                                                account of the historical importance of its fortifications.<br><br>
                
                                                The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters Théo
                                                Kerg, Joseph Kutter and Michel Majerus, and photographer Edward Steichen, whose The
                                                Family of Man exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's Memory of the World register, and
                                                is now permanently housed in Clervaux. Movie star Loretta Young was of Luxembourgish
                                                descent. <br>Luxembourg was the first city to be named European Capital of Culture
                                                twice.<br><br>
                                                Luxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic
                                                worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More
                                                recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.
                
                                                Most native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in
                                                the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring Germany.<br><br>
                                                Luxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.However, the large
                                                proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to
                                                the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is
                                                thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg
                                                population.<br><br>

                                                a cultural and historical region in north-eastern France, now located in the
                                                administrative region of Grand Est. Lorraine's name stems from the medieval kingdom of
                                                Lotharingia, which in turn was named for either Emperor Lothair I or King Lothair II. It
                                                later was ruled as the Duchy of Lorraine before the Kingdom of France annexed it in
                                                1766.<br><br>
                                                Traditional dishes in the region include: Quiche Lorraine,
                                                Pâté lorrain (chopped pork and veal flavoured with white wine and baked in puff pastry)

                                            Wallonia
                                                is a region of Belgium. As the southern portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily
                                                French-speaking, and accounts for 55% of Belgium's territory and a third of its
                                                population.<br><br>
                                                The capital of Wallonia is Namur, and the most populous city is Charleroi. Most of
                                                Wallonia's major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the Sambre and Meuse
                                                valley, the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north lies the Central Belgian
                                                Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the
                                                southeast lie the Ardennes, hilly and sparsely populated.<br><br>
                                                    Something interesting about festivals. The Ducasse de Mons (Walloon French for
                                                    Kermesse), is one of the UNESCO Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of
                                                    Humanity. It comprises two important parts: the procession, the descent and the
                                                    ascent of the shrine of Waltrude, and the combat between Saint George and the
                                                    dragon. The combat (after the procession), plays out on the Trinity Sunday between
                                                    12:30 pm and 1:00 pm on the Mons's central square. It represents the fight between
                                                    Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The dragon is a mannequin carried
                                                    and moved by the white men (fr:Hommes blancs). The dragon fights Saint George by
                                                    attacking with his tail. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise and the dragon
                                                    turns in the other direction. Saint George finally kills the dragon.
                
                                                    The Gilles of Binche and the giants' procession in Ath are also UNESCO Masterpieces
                                                    of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.<br><br>
                                                    Wallonia is famous for a number of different foods and drinks, a great many of which
                                                    are specialties of certain cities or regions. The 1957 Michelin Guide noted that
                                                    "regional food has put up heroic resistance and the Walloon provinces and Flemish
                                                    provinces are proud of their specialities." The Liège waffle a rich, dense,
                                                    sweet, and chewy waffle native to Liège, is the most popular type of waffle in
                                                    Belgium, and can be found in stores and even vending machines throughout the
                                                    country. Cougnou, or the bread of Jesus, is a sweet bread typically eaten around
                                                    Christmas time and found throughout the region.<br><br>
                
                                                    Other specialties include Herve cheese, an apple butter called sirop de Liège, the
                                                    Garden strawberry of Wépion. Also notable is the Dinant specialty Flamiche: These
                                                    cheese tarts are not found in window displays as they are meant to be eaten straight
                                                    from the oven. As one restaurateur said so well in a book about Walloon gastronomy
                                                    "it is the client who waits for the flamiche, as the flamiche does not wait for the
                                                    client. There are also the Ardennes ham, the tarte al djote from Nivelles, a
                                                    dessert pie made with beet leaves and cheese,[54] while tarte au riz is a
                                                    rice-pudding filled pie from Verviers.<br><br>
                
                                                    In terms of drink, Wallonia mirrors Belgium as a whole; beer and wine are both
                                                    popular, and a great diversity of beers are made and enjoyed in Wallonia.<br><br>

                                        <p class="lead">Saarland is located in western Germany covering an area of 2,570 km2 (990 sq mi) and a
                                                population of 995,600 (2015), the smallest German state in both area and population
                                                apart from the city-states of Berlin, Bremen, and Hamburg.Saarbrücken is the state
                                                capital and largest city, while other major cities include Neunkirchen and Saarlouis.
                                                Saarland is surrounded by France to the west (apart from a few kms. of the Moselle river
                                                bordering Luxembourg) and south and the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate to the
                                                north and east.<br><br>
                                                Live music is a feature of Saarland, especially at open-air concerts and in atmospheric
                                                locations. Examples include the Antattack Festival at the Dillinger Lokschuppen venue,
                                                the rock festival at the Hüttenpark former industrial site in Neunkirchen, and the
                                                RockCamp Festival at the open-air swimming pool in Saarwellingen. Even the Saarbrücken
                                                university campus likes it loud – at the AStA Open Air Festival. But for the season's
                                                really big event you have to go up into Püttlingen forest: Rocco del Schlacko. The event
                                                started out in 1999 as a mini festival that attracted 600 people and five local bands,
                                                but now attracts 20,000 fans who make the earth tremble at the Sauwasen site where it's
                                                held. The flamboyantly named open-air festival, which is held in a typical Saarland
                                                natural setting, has developed into a regular feature of the German summer festival
                                                season.<br><br>
