                            <h4>National Day: 23 June</h4>
                            <p>National Day in Luxembourg was originally meant to celebrate the Grand-Dukes birthday,
                                which
                                started once with the birthday of Grand Duchess Charlotte, which is on January 23rd. As
                                the
                                date of her birthday was in winter, the celebrations were postponed to a later date, on
                                June
                                23rd. The date remained unchanged even after her reign.<br>
                                The festivities all over the Grand-Duchy start on the eve of National day, June 22nd.
                                Luxembourg City starts the celebrations with a solemn changing of the guard at the
                                Grand-Ducal palace around 4:00 pm.<br>
                                In the evening a torchlight procession takes place throughout the capital city. The
                                public
                                areas and the narrow streets of Luxembourg transform into a huge open-air party with
                                free
                                concerts, DJ's and dance floors all over the city. It is the moment to try some local
                                specialties such as sausages, potato fritters, Luxembourgish beer or wine ...
                                Later at night, fireworks will be launched from the Adolphe bridge.<br>
                                On National Day (23/06), the day starts with an official ceremony, followed by a gun
                                salute
                                and a military parade in the district Kirchberg. The traditional Te Deum in the
                                afternoon
                                takes place at the cathedral Notre-Dame.</p>
